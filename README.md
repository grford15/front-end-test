This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Greg Rutherford - Front-End Technical Test

### Description 

Build a simple but well-structured single page application using a JavaScript component-based UI framework of your choice (e.g. Vue, React) that: 
1. Fetches data from a public API based on criteria entered by the user, and 2. displays the received data in a polished, user-friendly way. 

### Requirements 

Although this project is simple, try to keep your code as well-structured, maintainable, and consistent as possible. Write the code as if this project will continue to be worked on by developers other than yourself over the course of many years. Think about things like separation of concerns, identifying and writing reusable, single-purpose components, loose coupling, documentation and self-documenting, readable code, good Git practices etc. 

You don’t need to worry about adding a whole bunch of features; we’d rather you keep the functionality as simple as possible and focus instead on the quality and maintainability of the code. Some project examples are provided to give you an idea of what we’d expect in terms of functionality. 

The application should be as visually polished and professional as you can make it. It should not look out of place among the standard design patterns and aesthetics set by modern web applications, nor behave wildly differently from what users generally expect from a modern web application. You are free to write your own CSS and style components yourself, or alternatively use a CSS/component framework. Make sure the UI is clear, intuitive, and consistent. Make sure there are no spelling, punctuation, or grammatical errors.
