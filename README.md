This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Greg Rutherford - Front-End Technical Test

### Description 

Build a simple but well-structured single page application using a JavaScript component-based UI framework of your choice (e.g. Vue, React) that: 
1. Fetches data from a public API based on criteria entered by the user, and 2. displays the received data in a polished, user-friendly way. 

### My-Notes

- The first choice I made was to use the movies API that I found (Provided by https://www.themoviedb.org/). I wanted to use something different from the two listed in the PDF & thought this would interest me the most out of all the API's I looked through.

- My layout is pretty simple purely because I feel like that's all I wanted to return from the API for this project due to time constraints. If I was to work on this further I believe I could make it a lot more interactive & in-depth due to how good the API is, i.e I could include a link in each movie to direct the user to similar movies or recommended movies. I would also probably extend the site to include TV shows which are available in the API. Also, the images in each movie are just stock images but would be good to replace with movie posters.

- If I was to start this again I would change it visually, I started off with the heading image with the text which worked at the start but took me down the road of making the site quite dark. Personally I prefer sites to look light, quite minimalist so would make sure I took that route the next time.

- I have tried to complete this project in 2 hours like advised, but if I had longer I would have written tests throughout the process instead of testing it out by using the site. I felt very comfortable with the functionality the site would need so I was more than happy going ahead with creating it without tests. 

- I used Netlify to host the site which can be found with this link https://eager-ardinghelli-3298d8.netlify.com
